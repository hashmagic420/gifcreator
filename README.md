## Features

- **Draw on Canvas**: Create individual frames by drawing on a canvas.
- **Apply Text**: Add custom text to each frame.
- **Frame Copying**: Copy frames for symmetrical shapes or reusing designs.
- **Download GIF**: Once the frames are completed, the app compiles them into a GIF, which can be downloaded.
